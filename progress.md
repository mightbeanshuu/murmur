# Murmur Learning Progress

## Session 3 startup
- Read `sessions.md`, `progress.md`, `README.md`, and `package.json`.
- Scanned project file list with `rg --files`.
- Read streaming/UI path files:
  - `src/lib/swarm/types.ts`
  - `src/lib/swarm/bus.ts`
  - `src/app/api/swarm/route.ts`
  - `src/lib/store.ts`
  - `src/lib/useRunSwarm.ts`
  - `src/components/SwarmGraph.tsx`
  - `src/components/SidePanel.tsx`
  - `src/app/page.tsx`
- Selected Session 3 topic: SSE event pipeline from backend swarm events to live graph UI.

## Interview revision request
- User asked to explain project mapping files, important code blocks, senior-interview concepts, medium/hard questions with answers, Next.js/TypeScript fundamentals, and production/token tradeoffs.
- Read:
  - `src/lib/swarm/planner.ts`
  - `src/lib/swarm/orchestrator.ts`
  - `src/lib/swarm/worker.ts`
  - `src/lib/swarm/validator.ts`

## Teaching continuation
- Continued from build-from-zero roadmap.
- Focus: first commands, first folders/files, Next.js/TypeScript basics, and explaining why the swarm backend should be built before UI.

## Stored API/SSE/live-streaming notes
- Created `imp notes.md`.
- Stored the user-requested live streaming explanation and full flowchart:
  - `GoalBar` click
  - `useRunSwarm()`
  - `fetch("/api/swarm")`
  - `src/app/api/swarm/route.ts`
  - `runSwarm(goal, bus)`
  - `EventBus`
  - `ReadableStream`
  - SSE `data: ...\n\n`
  - `TextEncoder` / `TextDecoder`
  - browser buffer handling
  - `Zustand apply(event)`
  - React rerender path

## Stored Kafka and Redis production skills
- Updated `imp notes.md` with a dedicated production skills section for Kafka, Redis sessions, and rate limiting.
- Read and referenced:
  - `src/lib/swarm/kafka.ts`
  - `src/lib/swarm/rateLimit.ts`
  - `src/lib/swarm/session.ts`
  - `src/lib/swarm/bus.ts`
  - `src/lib/swarm/redis.ts`
  - `src/app/api/swarm/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/swarm/[runId]/route.ts`
- Added Session 7 to `sessions.md`.
- Skills captured:
  - Kafka topic/key/event publishing
  - Redis shared rate limiting
  - Redis run session projection
  - Redis Stream event replay
  - event envelope versioning
  - strict vs non-strict delivery tradeoffs

## Session 4 Zod explanation
- User asked to explain Zod using the tutor skill.
- Read `tech-learning-tutor` skill instructions.
- Scanned repo for Zod usage with `rg`.
- Read:
  - `src/lib/swarm/planner.ts`
  - `src/lib/swarm/validator.ts`
  - `src/lib/swarm/run.ts`
  - `src/lib/swarm/types.ts`
  - `src/lib/swarm/orchestrator.ts`
- Finding: Zod is used as the runtime contract for structured LLM outputs in planner and validator flows.

## Production upgrade: Kafka and Redis
- User requested production-level upgrades and a PR.
- Read:
  - `package.json`
  - `src/lib/swarm/bus.ts`
  - `src/app/api/swarm/route.ts`
  - `src/lib/swarm/run.ts`
  - `src/lib/swarm/models.ts`
  - `README.md`
- Added dependencies: `kafkajs`, `ioredis`.
- Added optional Kafka publisher for swarm events.
- Added optional Redis fixed-window rate limiter for run starts and model attempts.
- Added `.env.example` documenting OpenRouter, Kafka, and Redis settings.

## Mandatory Kafka/Redis production hardening
- User clarified that Kafka and Redis must be deeply integrated and required, then requested a GitHub push after completion.
- Consulted current primary documentation for KafkaJS producer keys/idempotence, Apache Kafka 4.3.1 Docker/KRaft configuration, and ioredis connection behavior.
- Added/changed:
  - `src/lib/swarm/config.ts`: required environment validation, TLS/SASL options, and timeout settings.
  - `src/lib/swarm/infrastructure.ts`: cached concurrent Kafka/Redis readiness probes.
  - `src/app/api/health/route.ts`: HTTP 200/503 readiness endpoint.
  - `src/app/api/swarm/route.ts`: fail-closed readiness gate before model usage.
  - `src/lib/swarm/redis.ts`: required shared client, command/connect timeouts, reconnect behavior, PING, and disconnect helper.
  - `src/lib/swarm/kafka.ts`: required idempotent producer, explicit topic, `runId` key, headers/timestamp, admin topic check, and disconnect helper.
  - `src/lib/swarm/session.ts`: atomic Lua projection + Redis Stream write with deterministic sequence IDs.
  - `src/lib/swarm/bus.ts`: Redis-first delivery, required Kafka publish, terminal iterator errors on durable-delivery failure.
  - `src/app/api/swarm/[runId]/route.ts`: run ID validation and Redis 503 handling.
  - `docker-compose.yml`: pinned Kafka 4.3.1, Redis 8.8.0, health checks, volumes, topic provisioning, six partitions, seven-day retention.
  - `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, standalone Next output, and pinned pnpm version.
  - `patches/kafkajs@2.2.4.patch`: prevents Node 24 negative-timer warnings when KafkaJS has no pending requests.
  - Removed build-time Google Fonts dependency for offline/restricted CI builds.
- Local configuration created in ignored `.env.local`; no secret was added.

### Commands and outcomes
- `pnpm lint`: passed.
- `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`: passed.
- `docker-compose config`: passed.
- First `pnpm infra:up`: failed because Colima/Docker daemon was stopped.
- `colima start`: succeeded.
- Second `pnpm infra:up`: images downloaded; Kafka failed due named-volume ownership (`AccessDeniedException`).
- Added one-shot root volume initializer; broker itself remains UID 1000/non-root.
- Third `pnpm infra:up`: Kafka and Redis healthy; Kafka topic initializer completed.
- `pnpm infra:topic`: verified six partitions, leader/ISR metadata, replication factor 1 locally, and seven-day retention.
- Redis `PING`: returned `PONG`.
- First `pnpm dev`: sandbox denied port 3000; elevated host run succeeded.
- `/api/health`: returned HTTP 200 with Kafka and Redis healthy.
- Node 24 emitted a KafkaJS negative timeout warning; traced to empty request queue scheduling and added a pinned pnpm patch. Repeated health checks then exited cleanly without the warning.
- First patch install aborted due no TTY; offline retry failed because one tarball was uncached; normal lockfile install restored dependencies and applied the corrected patch.
- First production build failed because `next/font/google` could not reach Google Fonts; replaced with offline system font stacks.
- Second production build hit sandbox-only Turbopack port binding; host-permitted `pnpm build` passed.
- `docker build -t murmur:local .`: first attempt exposed missing patch copy and unpinned pnpm; corrected Dockerfile/package metadata; final build passed.
- Production image smoke test on `murmur_default`: `/api/health` returned HTTP 200 for Kafka and Redis; temporary app container removed.
- Removed the temporary project-local `.pnpm-store` cache.

### Revisit items
- Local Compose is intentionally single-node and not high availability. Production needs replicated managed Kafka/Redis, TLS/SASL, backups, alerts, and topic replication factor 3.
- Redis and Kafka cannot share a transaction. Current ordering preserves Redis as the recoverable source and fails visibly on Kafka error; strict no-gap asynchronous publication needs an outbox worker.

## Fresh learning roadmap and deployed-provider correction
- User supplied a screenshot of the deployed Vercel UI and clarified that they believe a Grok key is configured there.
- Verified source configuration in:
  - `src/lib/swarm/models.ts`
  - `src/lib/swarm/run.ts`
  - `src/app/api/swarm/route.ts`
  - `.env.example`
- Finding: current source reads `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` only. No `GROK_API_KEY`, `XAI_API_KEY`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, xAI provider, or Grok default model is present.
- Screenshot inference: an AI provider key exists in the deployed environment because planner/worker execution started. The screenshot alone does not identify which model generated each output.
- Screenshot failure pattern recorded: analyst completed; three workers failed; synthesizer continued with fallback subtask text. This maps to the worker catch path in `orchestrator.ts` and all-model fallback behavior in `run.ts`.
- Added a fresh Sessions 9–18 roadmap to `sessions.md` covering provider failures, TypeScript, Next.js, Kafka, Redis, testing, durable orchestration, observability/security/cost, DevOps/deployment, and senior interview preparation.
- Started Session 9 with provider-vs-model distinction and screenshot-led failure diagnosis.
- No key values or secrets were read or stored.

## Vercel production readiness incident
- Reproduced the deployed failure at `GET /api/health`: HTTP 503, with Kafka and Redis both down at zero-millisecond probe latency.
- Linked the local checkout to the existing Vercel `murmur` project and inspected environment-variable names only; no secret values were read.
- Confirmed production currently contains `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` but no required Kafka or Redis configuration.
- Confirmed the latest GitHub commit built and deployed successfully. The failure is runtime dependency configuration, not compilation or deployment.
- Vercel Marketplace currently exposes Redis products but no Kafka product. Finishing the live fix requires a managed Kafka provider plus a managed Redis resource and their production connection settings.
- Preserved the fail-closed production design: no optional or in-memory Kafka/Redis fallback was introduced.
- Learning captured: build success vs runtime readiness, local Compose DNS vs public production endpoints, managed services, and why infrastructure credentials belong in the deployment environment rather than Git.

## Session 9 close / Session 10 start
- Searched current web status: Upstash Kafka discontinued March 11, 2025 (corrected prior assumption it was still viable). Redis Cloud confirmed live on Vercel Marketplace.
- User chose Redpanda Cloud (Kafka) + Redis Cloud via Vercel Marketplace (Redis) for the production fix; signups not yet completed by user.
- Re-read `src/lib/swarm/run.ts` and `src/lib/swarm/models.ts`; identified that `shouldFallback(e)` in `runText()` does not actually gate the retry loop (no `else { throw }`), so non-retryable errors still walk the full model chain before `AllModelsFailed`. `runObject`/`genObject` don't call `shouldFallback` at all.
- Started Session 10 (TypeScript through Murmur): read `src/lib/swarm/types.ts` and `src/lib/swarm/orchestrator.ts` line by line.

## Session 11 — SSE review + Redis + Docker deep dives
- Learner requested out-of-roadmap-order teaching: SSE/EventBus review, then Redis, then Docker/Compose; Next.js session explicitly pushed to the very end.
- Re-read `src/lib/swarm/bus.ts` and `src/app/api/swarm/route.ts` for the SSE deep dive.
- Read `src/lib/swarm/redis.ts`, `src/lib/swarm/session.ts`, `src/lib/swarm/rateLimit.ts` for the Redis deep dive (both Lua scripts explained line by line).
- Read `docker-compose.yml` and `Dockerfile` for the Docker deep dive.
- No code changes made this session — teaching only.

## Session 12 — Full backend scan + master deep dive
- Scanned every remaining backend file: `src/lib/swarm/config.ts`, `src/lib/swarm/infrastructure.ts`, `src/app/api/health/route.ts`, `src/app/api/swarm/[runId]/route.ts`, `src/lib/store.ts` (plus re-verified all previously read swarm files and `useRunSwarm.ts`).
- Wrote the "MASTER DEEP DIVE — Full Backend Scan" section into `imp notes.md`: 10-layer walkthrough (config → readiness → connections → Lua scripts → AI executors → agents → EventBus → API gates/stream → replay → browser reducer), master flowchart, failure-mode table, and master interview answers.
- Wrote "THE CANDIDATE HANDBOOK" section into `imp notes.md`: stack-at-a-glance table, full annotated end-to-end flowchart + 12-step narrative, routes reference, Redis data structures + all five rate-limiting algorithms compared, Kafka vocabulary + Murmur's exact producer/topic choices, per-tech senior interview Q&A (Next.js, TypeScript, AI SDK/Zod, SSE, EventBus, Redis, Kafka, system design), and a rapid-fire glossary.
- No code changes — documentation and teaching only.

## Session 14 — Testing: DAG wave scheduling + Redis integration tests
- User requested: skip Kafka for now, focus rate-limiter question follow-up (what is Lua), then testing — specifically Redis integration tests, plus whatever else is left in the project (DAG waves, etc).
- Checked local infra: `murmur-redis-1` container already running/healthy.
- Installed `vitest` as a dev dependency (`pnpm add -D vitest`), added `"test": "vitest run"` to `package.json` scripts.
- Extracted the orchestrator's inline `ready()` closure into `src/lib/swarm/dagSchedule.ts` (`nextWave`, `planWaves`) — pure, dependency-free functions — and updated `src/lib/swarm/orchestrator.ts` to import `nextWave` instead of the local closure. Behavior unchanged; confirmed via `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` (clean).
- Added `src/lib/swarm/dagSchedule.test.ts`: 7 unit tests covering parallel waves, sequential chains, fan-in, direct cycle detection, and missing-dependency detection.
- Added `src/lib/swarm/redis.integration.test.ts`: 8 integration tests against the REAL local Redis container — rate limiter boundary/TTL-guard behavior (directly verifying the count===1 checkpoint answered earlier), and `persistRunEvent` idempotency/ordering (replay no-op, stale-sequence rejection).
- `pnpm test`: 2 files, 15/15 passed. `pnpm lint`: clean.
- No Kafka work this session per explicit user request.

## Placement handbook and professional PDF
- Loaded the technical tutoring instructions and adapted the artifact to the learner's fast, architecture-first Basic-to-Interview route.
- Audited source behavior across the frontend, all API routes, EventBus, orchestration, AI/Zod, Redis Lua/session store, Kafka producer/readiness, Dockerfile, Compose, and package versions.
- Researched current primary documentation for every technology and recurring interview themes from LeetCode Discuss, Naukri Code360, and GeeksforGeeks. Firecrawl authentication existed but its credit balance was zero; direct web research was used instead.
- Created `Murmur_Placement_Handbook.md` with 18 modules and 16,500+ words:
  - four frontend modules;
  - six backend modules;
  - three infrastructure/production modules;
  - three interview/revision modules plus opening/system-map modules.
- Added six custom SVG flowcharts:
  - end-to-end browser/API/orchestrator/durability flow;
  - EventBus live versus durable branches;
  - DAG waves and validation;
  - Redis rate limiter and atomic session persistence;
  - Kafka producer/partitions/future consumer groups;
  - local Compose versus production deployment.
- Added a canonical correction ledger to `imp notes.md` to supersede earlier overstatements about durable-before-visible delivery, automatic replay, cancellation, Kafka consumers, exactly-once semantics, and local HA.
- Created dense black-and-white print CSS with color reserved for diagrams.
- Rendered `Murmur_Placement_Handbook.html` with Pandoc and `Murmur_Placement_Handbook.pdf` with headless Chrome.
- Final PDF verification: A4, 35 pages, 1.8 MB, tagged, unencrypted; TOC fits one page; sampled diagrams/tables/code/glossary/source pages render without clipping.

## Session 16 — Production-readiness fixes (real code changes)
- User asked for the correct fault list plus actual fixes to make orchestration reliable, and to distinguish "fixed now" from "legitimate future upgrade, not required."
- Verified two suspected faults against source before fixing: `models.ts:38-44` (`hasPaidAccess` caches ANY probe outcome, including network failures, forever per process) and `run.ts:53-55` (`shouldFallback` check had no `else { throw }`, so it never actually gated the retry loop).
- Implemented fixes:
  - `src/lib/swarm/models.ts`: `hasPaidAccess()` no longer caches a failed probe — only a successful result (true/false) is cached; a fetch failure resets `paidProbe` to null so the next call retries instead of permanently pinning the process to the free-tier chain.
  - `src/lib/swarm/run.ts`: rewrote `runText`/`runObject`/`genObject`. Added `checkModelRateLimit()` helper that distinguishes a genuine `RateLimitError` (skip to next model) from any other error out of `enforceRateLimit` — e.g. Redis unreachable — which now rethrows immediately instead of being silently treated as "this model failed." `shouldFallback(e)` now actually gates: a non-retryable error throws `AllModelsFailed` immediately instead of wasting the rest of the chain. Added `"empty completion"` as an explicitly retryable condition (previously implicit via the dead gate) since a model succeeding with empty output is legitimately worth retrying on a different model. Added `attemptSignal()` combining the existing per-attempt `AbortSignal.timeout` with an optional caller-provided `signal` via `AbortSignal.any`. Exported `AllModelsFailed` (was module-private).
  - `src/lib/swarm/planner.ts` / `src/lib/swarm/validator.ts`: catch blocks now only degrade (fallback plan / auto-approve) when the caught error is `instanceof AllModelsFailed` — any other error (infra failure surfaced through `run.ts`) rethrows, so a Redis outage mid-run now produces a visible failed task/run instead of a silently degraded result.
  - `src/lib/swarm/rateLimit.ts`: removed the dead try/catch in `enforceRateLimit` that rethrew unconditionally on both branches — no behavior change, cleanup only.
  - Cancellation propagation: `src/app/api/swarm/route.ts` now passes `req.signal` into `runSwarm`; `orchestrator.ts` accepts `signal?: AbortSignal`, checks `signal?.aborted` at the top of each DAG wave and before synthesis (emits an error + `bus.close("failed")` and returns if aborted), and threads `signal` through `runWorker` (`worker.ts`), `validate` (`validator.ts`), `plan` (`planner.ts`), and the synthesis `runText` call. A client disconnecting mid-run now stops further model calls at the next checkpoint instead of continuing invisibly.
- Verified: `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` clean, `pnpm test` 15/15 passed (no test changes needed — behavior covered was orthogonal to the DAG/Redis integration tests), `pnpm lint` clean.
- Did NOT implement (documented as legitimate future upgrades, not required for current scope): transactional outbox for Redis→Kafka, durable/resumable workflow state (BullMQ/Temporal/Inngest), EventBus backpressure bounding, dead-letter queue for repeatedly-failing tasks, real auth/multi-tenancy, observability (structured logs/metrics/traces), provider-reported token usage instead of length/4 estimate.
